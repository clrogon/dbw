## [Unreleased]

- Offline fallback page and `NetworkFirst` caching strategy for API calls.
- `ProtectedRoute` component for admin route guards.
- `useAuth` hook with `AuthProvider` context for session and admin state management.
- `useCms` hooks for all CMS tables (`useHeroContent`, `useCmsServices`, `usePricingPlans`, `useCmsInstructors`, `useCmsGallery`).
- `normaliseCms.ts` utility for CMS data normalisation.
- cPanel full migration wizard documentation (`docs/cpanel-full-migration-wizard.md`).
- Deployment guide with Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, Docker, and cPanel configs.
- Component documentation (`docs/components.md`).

### Changed
- HeroSection, ServicesPreview, PricingSection, Services, Instructors, and Gallery pages now fetch from CMS database instead of static data.
- Admin pages invalidate TanStack Query cache on save for instant public-site updates.

### Fixed
- RLS policies changed from RESTRICTIVE to PERMISSIVE to fix CMS read/write operations.
- Added `TO authenticated` target on all admin write policies.
- `useAuth` hook avoids race conditions by checking admin status immediately after `signInWithPassword`.

### Security
- All RLS policies verified as PERMISSIVE with `is_admin()` checks on write operations.
- Session tokens stored in `sessionStorage` instead of `localStorage`.
- Admin roles stored in separate `user_roles` table (not on profile).
- `service_role` key excluded from all frontend code.
